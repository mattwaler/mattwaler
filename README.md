# 👋🏼 Hello there! My name is Matt.

I am a fullstack developer from Ohio. I specialize in the latest and greatest frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte. I am a firm believer that simple, pragmatic, and readable code is far superior to complex abstractions and over-engineering.

Ask me about my Eleventy, TailwindCSS, and AlpineJS addictions.
