# The most easy-going web developer you'll ever meet.

I design, develop, deploy, and teach all things modern web development. I also love playing Tennis and lifting weights.

## My Skills

### Frontend Development

My biggest strength is turning static mockups and designs into fully responsive codebases. I am proficient in the latest and greatest frontend frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, and TailwindCSS.

### Backend Development

I can build full-blown traditional content management systems with Craft CMS, or headless APIs for accessing and consuming data with Node and GraphQL.

### Accessibility

I am constantly making sure the code I produce is WCAG compliant and accessible to all users, regardless of their disabilities. Nobody should have a poor experience when it comes to the web.
