# 👋🏼 Hello! I'm Matt Waler.

I am a frontend-focused developer from Ohio. I graduated from Ohio University in 2016 and I've been developing ever since. I am a firm believer that simple, pragmatic, and readable code is far superior to complex abstractions. 

## 🛠 Skills 

I specialize in the following tools:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/)

## 😊 Hobbies

If I'm not writing code here, you'll most likely find me:

- Playing Tennis
- Practicing on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/w4ler)
- Squeezing in a quick lifting session
- Searching for new pop music
