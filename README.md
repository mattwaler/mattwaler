# 👋🏼 Hello there! My name is Matt.

I am a fullstack developer from Ohio. I specialize in the latest and greatest frontend frameworks like Node, React, and Svelte. I also dabble with fullstack projects like Craft CMS and Statamic. I am a firm believer that simple, pragmatic, and readable code is far superior to complex abstractions and over-engineering.

Ask me anything about my Tennis, Chess, and Tailwind CSS addictions.
