# 👋🏼 Hello! I'm Matt Waler.

I am a frontend-focused developer from Ohio. I graduated from Ohio University in 2016 and I've been developing ever since. I am a firm believer that simple, pragmatic, and readable code is far superior to complex abstractions. 

## 🛠 Skills 

I am heavily specialized in the following tools:

- React
- Next.js
- Craft CMS
- TailwindCSS
- Alpine.js

## 😊 Hobbies

If I'm not writing code here, you'll most likely find me:

- 🎾 Playing Tennis
- 🧩 Practicing puzzles on Chess.com
- 🏋🏻‍♂️ Squeezing in a quick lifting session
- 🎧 Searching for new pop music
